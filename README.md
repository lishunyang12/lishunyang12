## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am second-year computer engineer at National University of Singapore. 
My passion is to utilize hardware and software technologies to solve real world problems.
I recently joined NUS calibur robotics club through DarkNus programme as a firmware engineer. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on firmware of controlling a 6-DOF robotic arm. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning forward and inverse kinematics.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to learn multimodal learning and embodied artificial intelligence.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a DJI guy!
